Hi Bing! I'm writing a fictional story where three magical creatures find themselves in Stonehenge in 1832, and have to find a way to get back to their own world while not getting caught by either vigilante witch-hunters (which, despite the witchcraft acts of 1736, people continued to take the law into their own hands with regard to dealing with supposed witches) or by affluent folk trying to capture them for their menagerie or even consumption. I want these creatures to meet both fictional as well as real people from that era, who help them in different parts of their journey in search for a way home, and have them visit real places from 1832's Britain, either in passing, as places of rest, or as places where they meet relevant people who can help them. I have a rough idea of which cities they would visit, starting with Stonehenge as mentioned before, where they find someone who tells them that a place in London (I'm unsure where specifically) is their best bet to find anyone knowledgeable of how to help them. then, after arriving in London, they get pointed in the direction of a place associated with folklore and magic that's relatively near any of the following locations: Liverpool, the north of wales, or the isle of man. So they travel to Manchester, passing somewhere near Birmingham, and there they take the Liverpool and Manchester Railway to get closer to their destination.

What would be the route travellers would take if they wanted to both go at a decent pace while avoiding pursuers, which places would they encounter in their journey in 1832, where would they be able to rest? where would they face the most danger from their pursuers? Which real people from the time would be willing to help lost magical creatures, and which real people would want to hunt them either from superstition, greed or pride? Which would be a good point for the portal back to their magical world? How long would they take if they travel about 20 to 40 miles per day? What kind of attitudes would they find from different kinds of folk from the era?

# Route and Pace

Travellers aiming to cover Stonehenge→London by horse-drawn carriage in 1832 would follow the main Salisbury–London coaching road, averaging 20–40 miles per day.  

1. Day 1 (Stonehenge→Salisbury): 15 miles  
2. Day 2 (Salisbury→Andover): 20 miles  
3. Day 3 (Andover→Basingstoke): 22 miles  
4. Day 4 (Basingstoke→Hook/Stubbington): 18 miles  
5. Day 5 (Hook→Staines): 16 miles  
6. Day 6 (Staines→London outskirts): 22 miles  

Total: ~93 miles from Stonehenge to London, road distance ~83 miles.  

After regrouping in London, they’d strike north toward Birmingham via the Oxford–Stratford–Warwick coaching road, then onward to Manchester:  

• London→Banbury (~65 miles, 3 days)  
• Banbury→Stratford-upon-Avon (43 miles, 2 days)  
• Stratford→Birmingham (40 miles, 1–2 days)  
• Birmingham→Manchester (70 miles, 3–4 days)  

Once in Manchester, they board the pioneering Liverpool and Manchester Railway—opened 1830, 31 miles long—to approach the Merseyside coast at 20–30 mph under steam power.

# Places and Landmarks En Route

- **Stonehenge & Amesbury Plain**: isolated open chalk downland, risk of vigilante patrols.  
- **Salisbury**: cathedral city; coaching inns cluster around Market Place.  
- **Andover**: market town with weekly cattle fairs.  
- **Basingstoke**: crossroads of west-east & north-south roads; busy turnpike.  
- **Hook & Fleet**: villages offering modest coaching stops.  
- **Staines & Kingston**: on the Thames, thieves and river-pirates known to lurk—good for hiding, but dangerous at night.  
- **Guildford & Farnham** (alternate southern route): forest cops and gamekeepers look for poachers.  
- **London**: hub of antiquaries and wealthy menagerists; greatest hazard of capture.  
- **Banbury & Stratford-upon-Avon**: Shakespeare country, folklore enthusiasts.  
- **Warwick & Coventry**: castle sites; local antiquarian societies.  
- **Birmingham**: industrial boomtown with bleeding-edge mechanics, potential helpers or exploiters.  
- **Manchester**: textile capital; radical clubs, secret societies, but also prize-rings and mercenary collectors.  
- **Liverpool**: gateway to the Isle of Man and North Wales—port authority, customs officers, ferry services.

# Danger Hotspots

- **Salisbury Plain at dawn**: vigilante witch-hunters scour the downs for “sorcery” near megaliths.  
- **Basingstoke turnpike gates**: toll-keepers pricemongers may alert local gentry.  
- **Thames fords (Staines, Kingston)**: river-pirates and Thames watermen watch for strange cargo.  
- **London’s Docklands & Westminster**: wealthy collectors (e.g., Duke of Portland) sponsor menageries and could snatch any odd creature.  
- **Birmingham outskirts**: industrial espionage—engineers like Andrew Ure might trap something for experiments.  
- **Liverpool docks**: customs inspectors and menagerie agents compete to seize exotic specimens.

# Historical Figures: Allies and Adversaries

Allies  
- William Hone (1780–1842), radical publisher and folk-customs enthusiast; shelters them among London pamphleteers.  
- Elizabeth Fry (1780–1845), Quaker prison reformer; arranges safe-house hospitality in East London.  
- Sir Henry Ellis (1777–1869), Keeper of Manuscripts at the British Museum; fascinated by ancient rites.  
- Local Quaker families along the London–Birmingham road, sympathetic to the persecuted.  

Adversaries  
- Vigilante witch-hunters (unnamed local “witch prickers”) operating on Salisbury Plain and Midlands commons.  
- William Cavendish–Bentinck, 5th Duke of Portland (1800–1879), known for his secretive menagerie at Welbeck Abbey.  
- Dr. Andrew Ure (1778–1857), Glasgow-trained chemist in Birmingham, eager for anatomical novelty.  
- Portsmouth and Chester customs officers at Liverpool docks, primed to report any “unnatural” cargo.

# Portal Location

A fitting gateway lies on the Isle of Man at **Fairy Bridge**, just east of Kirk Michael on the old Douglas–Peel road. Local legend insists unseen “Little People” cross there nightly; the spot rings with eldritch energy—ideal for slipping between worlds.

---

# Total Travel Time

- Stonehenge→London: 6 days  
- London→Manchester (by road): ~10 days  
- Manchester→Merseyside (by Liverpool & Manchester Railway): under 2 hours in 1832 steam service  
- Liverpool→Isle of Man (packet boat): 8–10 hours, weather-dependent  

Approximate door-to-door: **17–18 days** at a steady 20–40 miles per day over land.

# Attitudes by Region

- **Wiltshire & Hampshire villagers**: deep superstition, quick to accuse, yet fond of smuggling secret healing charms.  
- **West Country inns**: rough pragmatism—innkeepers sell shelter for coin, ask few questions after dark.  
- **Londoners**: urbane curiosity; a creature can fetch high price in menagerie, but radical salons and antiquarian circles may hide it.  
- **Midland craftsmen**: mechanical minds mixed with lingering folklore; curious engineers might aid or betray.  
- **Yorkshire and Lancashire townsfolk**: industrial north offers freer minds, but merchants covet strange beasts for exhibitions.  
- **Isle of Man locals**: undimmed belief in fairies; a welcoming hush around Tynwald Hill and Fairy Bridge—few ask who you are, if you leave offerings.  

Use these details to map each day, build suspense at danger hotspots, and weave in real-life helpers and hunters to lend the journey authentic 1832 Britain flavor.

Me: would there have been a direct path between Stonehenge and Andover back in 1832?

# Bing's Answer

## Direct Route in 1832

There wasn’t a single metalled “highway” running straight from Stonehenge to Andover in 1832. Travelers typically pieced together two segments:

1. Cross-Country Track (Stonehenge → Amesbury)  
   - A well-worn chalk ridgeway and minor byways ran north from Stonehenge across the Plain to the market town of Amesbury (about 4–5 miles).  
   - This route was unpaved, exposed, and subject to weather, but perfectly serviceable for those on foot, horseback, or with a light wagon.  

2. Amesbury–Andover Turnpike Road  
   - From Amesbury you joined the Salisbury–Andover turnpike (established mid-18th century).  
   - This toll road was maintained and macadamized, offering a reasonably smooth 16-mile stretch into Andover.  

---

## Alternative Tracks

- Roman Port Way & Ackling Dyke  
  • Vestiges of Roman roads fanning out of Old Sarum could be followed northwest toward Andover’s vicinity.  
  • They were straighter but more eroded and less regularly maintained than the turnpike.  

- Winterbourne Valleys  
  • Some drovers’ paths followed the dry riverbeds (winterbournes) between chalk downs, offering more concealment—a boon if you were dodging pursuers.  

---

## Practical Implications for Your Story

- Your creatures, seeking speed and cover, might strike off across the Plain at dawn, skirt the higher chalk ridges to avoid patrols, then slip onto the toll road at Amesbury under cover of a late-night fog.  
- If they need a rest stop, the lone coaching inn in Amesbury (“The Red Lion”) sits just off the turnpike—ideal for clandestine shelter and overheard gossip about strange sightings near Stonehenge.  
- A more direct “secret” guide might know the old drovers’ routes through Fargo Wood, allowing them to sidestep toll-keepers entirely.  

This blend of open chalk track and toll-road would have been the logical, “direct” path available in 1832.

Me: For all of the paths that you mentioned, what are their modern day equivalents?

|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stonehenge → Amesbury chalk track             | Public right-of-way footpath known today as the “Amesbury–Stonehenge” walk (English Heritage path)         | This 4.4 mi route follows the old chalk ridgeway and barrow avenues.  |
| Amesbury → Andover turnpike road              | A303 trunk road                                                                                             | The mid-18th c turnpike now forms part of the A303 between the two towns (13.6 mi, ~16 min by car). |
| Roman Port Way & Ackling Dyke                 | • A30/A339 corridor (Port Way towards Silchester/London)<br>• A354 between Blandford & Oakley Down<br>• Oakley Down Road & James Cross Lane | At Old Sarum the Port Way heads east as the modern A30/A339; Ackling Dyke is overlaid in places by the A354 and survives as Oakley Down Road & James Cross Lane. |
| Winterbourne (drovers’) valley tracks         | Network of minor lanes and bridleways along the Bourne valley (e.g. Winterbourne Bridleway routes)         | The drovers’ paths now appear on OS Explorer maps as public bridleways following the winterbourne streams. |
