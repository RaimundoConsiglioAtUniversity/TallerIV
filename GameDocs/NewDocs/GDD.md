Hi Bing! I'm writing a fictional story where three magical creatures find themselves in Stonehenge in 1832, and have to find a way to get back to their own world while not getting caught by either vigilante witch-hunters (which, despite the witchcraft acts of 1736, people continued to take the law into their own hands with regard to dealing with supposed witches) or by affluent folk trying to capture them for their menagerie or even consumption. I want these creatures to meet both fictional as well as real people from that era, who help them in different parts of their journey in search for a way home, and have them visit real places from 1832's Britain, either in passing, as places of rest, or as places where they meet relevant people who can help them. I have a rough idea of which cities they would visit, starting with Stonehenge as mentioned before, where they find someone who tells them that a place in London (I'm unsure where specifically) is their best bet to find anyone knowledgeable of how to help them. then, after arriving in London, they get pointed in the direction of a place associated with folklore and magic that's relatively near any of the following locations: Liverpool, the north of wales, or the isle of man. So they travel to Manchester, passing somewhere near Birmingham, and there they take the Liverpool and Manchester Railway to get closer to their destination.

What would be the route travellers would take if they wanted to both go at a decent pace while avoiding pursuers, which places would they encounter in their journey in 1832, where would they be able to rest? where would they face the most danger from their pursuers? Which real people from the time would be willing to help lost magical creatures, and which real people would want to hunt them either from superstition, greed or pride? Which would be a good point for the portal back to their magical world? How long would they take if they travel about 20 to 40 miles per day? What kind of attitudes would they find from different kinds of folk from the era?
