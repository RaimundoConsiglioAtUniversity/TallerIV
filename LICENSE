Hi, this is a project I'm working on for uni, and I had to make it source-available since my professor is having trouble with github. I ask that you don't use the code in here unless you ask me. This project also includes some open source libraries and creative commons assets, all of them which you should be able to use without issue, but at the moment of writing I don't have them all compiled in a simple to find file, so discretion is advised
